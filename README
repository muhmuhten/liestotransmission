## liestotransmission

Two monkeypatches to the internal workings of transmission-daemon.

- report success on failure with EINVAL when setting TOS
- listen for connections on the socket at fd 0 instead of binding a new one

### this sounds horrifying, why this

Compared to writing parsing code into libevent, upstreaming the changes, and
then getting transmission to import those changes and also fix their validation
checks so that it'll do any good, this is way easier.

Mangling data as it passes through well-defined interfaces with a reasonable
expectation of ABI compatibility is somewhat less likely to break than somewhat
intrusive source patches, and maintains a cleaner separation of weird special
cases that it'd be tedious and hard to design a generalization for.
